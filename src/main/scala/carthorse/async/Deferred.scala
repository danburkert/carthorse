/**
 * A wrapper around [[com.stumbleupon.async.Deferred]] which provides type-safety and a convenient
 * API at the expense of slightly more memory usage and object creation overhead.
 *
 * The `Deferred` API is modeled after [[scala.concurrent.Future]], but has slightly different
 * semantics about when callbacks will be executed due to the underlying reliance on
 * [[com.stumbleupon.async.Deferred]]. If a deferred is complete, then adding a callback
 * will cause the callback to execute and complete immediately in the same thread. If a deferred is
 * incomplete the callback will be executed at a later time by the thread which delivers a value to
